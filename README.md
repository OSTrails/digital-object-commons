# digital-object-commons
A repository for defining the mappings between different digital object types

Object types describe the type of digital research object that a resource is intended for. Examples include the a repository that stores images, a knowledgebase that synthesises content from a number of different dataset sources, a standard that is defined for models, and a metric that applies to terminologies. By utilising object types within OSTrails, we are able to group and filter FAIR IF, DMP IF, and SKG IF components as required by the type of research object those components are applicable for.

## Sources and Attribution
There are a number of community-developed efforts that describe research objects; a selection of these are mapped to our object types within this repository. The ontologies currently mapped are:

## Other considerations
One of the other sources for object types was Zenodo (https://www.zenodo.org/, https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.wy4egf), however as they also based their object types on schema.org, we felt it best to also map to schema.org wherever possible.
