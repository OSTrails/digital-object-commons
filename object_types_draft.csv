The DataCite 'Physical Object' is a good idea, but note that its definition says ""Description: A physical object or substance.

Interestingly, schema.org has two options only:  and https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode so we will need to use both. Zenodo uses a ‘Software’ that points to SoftwareSourceCode, but this isn’t very useful.
